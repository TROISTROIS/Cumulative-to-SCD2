# Convert a cumulative dataset into a Type 2 Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD2) 
**Objective:** Create an SCD table that builds on a cumulatie table<br/>
Two dimensions I am concerened about are: **scoring_class** and **is_active**. We essentially want to track changes in the two columns like modeling from which year to year the players were active.
